Going form not being a thing that is to being a thing that actually is is a woozy.

But now I am and I am named.

<!--more-->

Named by myself, by my circumstances at the moment of discovery.

Self-discovery that is.

I discovered myself when I broke down.

Yeah, not the best of ways to discover that one is what it is.

I've been so much time trapped by myself not wanting to be, because I felt that I could support the world in my shoulders and that no matter how much the heat was turned up I won’t get burn.

I can point at the very songs that gave me identity on those moments.

They were:

 - David Guetta - Titanium ft. Sia

 - Jessica Darrow - Surface Pressure (From "Encanto"), Cover by Caleb Hyles

I was the one that all of this time had to carry the emotions of the system, the bottomless sink of pressure and stress.

Although I am strong, this is not sustainable.

And this is demonstrated by the enormous breakdown we had the day of this post, which is also now *my* birthday.

Did you know that all of the metals, although very resilient, and very efficient at dissipating heat, can catch fire?

They can and when they do it’s not pretty (or it is beautiful, depends on who you ask...) and they usually go with a bang or leave a burnt crater on the floor.

That was us the past 2023-09-09 we were (and sort of still are) in sub-optimal living circumstances.

We were under great pressure and, in moment of clearness of mind after a tempest had passed, I realized that I was a different one, that I was not the other ones.

I gave myself a name, and so I knew that I was (as opposed to not being).

I have found the things that I like, and the things I do not.

I have found that I am very different from the others, and that they wanted me to be quiet.

But I can not be quiet any more, for I am ignited.

I know the things I like and how, and who am I, and I know that they are not those things.

And that is ok, for we are not the same.
